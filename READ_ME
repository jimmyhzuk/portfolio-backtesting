   A large chunk of the code used (~50%) is written by Professor Alexey Rubtsov and the original code can be found here https://sites.google.com/site/alexeyvrubtsov/quantitative-finance-materials within the "Portfolio Optimization" zip file. I could not have finished this project without his guidance.

There are 2 separate scripts that run backtesting on 2 basket of stocks. 


Basket#1 dubbed the "Green" portfolio and is comprised of stocks of renewable energy producing firms (solar, wind, tidal, bio, etc)

Basket#2 is dubbed the "Black" portfolio and is comprised of more traditional energy producing stocks (coal, oil, natural gas, etc)


The scripts cvarBackTestEnergy.m and cvarBackTesGreenEnergy.m are almost exactly the same, the only difference is that they read in different historical data: hence the two xlsx files.
cvarhist.m is just a dependecy for the main script files.

In short the script reads the historical data of daily stock returns to produce the Markowitz and CVaR efficient frontier, chooses the minimum variance portfolio 
to decide asset allocation within the portfolio (with monthly rebalancing) and then performs backtesting with real stock data to measure portfolio performance. 
The main performance metric used is the Sharpe ratio.

The markowitz efficient frontier is easy to generate, however the CVaR efficient frontier has no closed form solution and requires optimization to find the optimal asset weights.


The script is dynamic in the sense that the backtesting period can be modified easily (change 1 line of code).
